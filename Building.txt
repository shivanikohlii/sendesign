Steps Before Building:
1. Put the cocos2d folder in the root directory of the project (This is just the folder with all of the components of the cocos2d library, I'll post a link to download it later).
2. Put the Resources folder in the root directory of the project (This just contains all of the assets for the game. I'll post a link with this later).
